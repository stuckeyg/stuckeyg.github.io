                <span class="hugeLetter">L</span>yme disease hits close to home for New York Senator John W. Mannion. When his daughter was a teenager, she suddenly became sick. Without knowing what was wrong, she was admitted to the hospital with symptoms including crossed eyes, blurred vision, and brain pressure. The illness that almost killed her was later identified as Lyme Meningitis.

        </br> </br>

“This is all for my daughter because it was a very scary experience,” Mannion said at a press conference at the Community Library of Jamesville and DeWitt. “I'm so fortunate that we have these experts and advocates here in Central New York.”

 </br> </br>

New York State has the second highest number of Lyme disease cases in the United States, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/index.html">Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>. Lyme Disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks. Typical symptoms for infected people include fever, headache, fatigue, and rashes, but can also be more severe, according to the CDC. Suffolk County on Long Island has the most cases of Lyme disease infections, according to New York State data from 2014-2016.

            <p class="paragraph">In the past decade, Lyme disease has become more prevalent across the country. Deer ticks are primarily found in the upper Midwest and the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The Tri-state area has the highest number of Lyme Disease cases in the U.S. with New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania with a combined 9,424 cases in 2021. Ticks commonly live in wooded, grassy, or shrubby areas so it’s common for people to get infected when doing outdoor activities. 

 </br> </br>

       “I was one of those people who did not see the tick and did not know I was bitten because I had no bullseye rash,” said Royale Scuderi, executive director of <a href="https://cnylymealliance.org/">CNY Lyme/Tick Alliance</a>. “I steadily got worse to the point where I couldn’t get out of bed, I couldn’t work. The pain was so bad, I couldn't get dressed, I couldn't form complete sentences, and I couldn’t remember words.”

            <p class="paragraph">After years of care and treatment, Scuderi ended up with $60,000 in medical debt. While people suffering from Lyme are often given doxycycline, an antibiotic prescription used to treat various tick-borne diseases, many don’t get it soon enough and therefore suffer from chronic symptoms. Scuderi said she was one of the lucky ones because she had good insurance and her husband had the job flexibility to take her to treatments. Yet, she still spent many years suffering alone. 
</br> </br>

“Nobody talked about it, I couldn't find a doctor, there were no support groups, nothing,” Scuderi added. “Then, about five years ago, a former colleague of mine said, ‘Hey, we're going to do something about this, we need you to come and run it.’ So four years later, here we are.”

</br> </br>

The CNY/Lyme Tick Alliance is a non-profit that works to share stories and educate people about Lyme disease in Central New York. The alliance has a support group where people can come together and share their experiences of living with Lyme disease. The non-profit also provides resources to the public to check for ticks and educates them on safe prevention practices such as wearing high socks or pants outdoors and using insect repellent.
</br> </br>

The alliance even addresses the seasons when people should be most careful of ticks. The summer is when the highest number of people get sick with Lyme disease because ticks thrive in warm climates. In 2021, July was the peak season for Lyme cases as 4,970 were recorded by the CDC. The alliance suggests that people stay vigilant about their clothing choices when going outside in the spring and summer. They also advise the public to do tick checks on themselves and their animals after coming inside from outdoor activity.

       “I was one of those people who did not see the tick and did not know I was bitten because I had no bullseye rash,” said Royale Scuderi, executive director of CNY Lyme/Tick Alliance. “I steadily got worse to the point where I couldn’t get out of bed, I couldn’t work. The pain was so bad, I couldn't get dressed, I couldn't form complete sentences, and I couldn’t remember words.”

 </br>      </br>
The medical community is also working to increase awareness of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. Dr. Saravanan Thangamani is the director of the SUNY Upstate Vector Biology Lab where he and a team of researchers collect tick samples from across the country to study and track the diseases they carry. With their research, they created a <a href="https://nyticks.org/">dashboard</a> that offers free surveillance data to the public to track ticks. However, the team recently had to pause their Free Tick Program and research due to a lack of funding. 

 </br>      </br>

“Right now, we are trying our best to secure more funds so that we can continue to support it,” Thangamani said. “I don’t want to say no to anyone. Because anytime someone sends a tick from outside of the state, they always send it with a small statement saying they found the tick on their 10-month-old daughter or young son. So as a parent, I can't say no in that situation.”
 </br>      </br>
The program became overwhelmed by the number of ticks the public sent for testing. This is in part because tick-borne illnesses are becoming more common in the United States. Between 2011 and 2019, cases of tick-borne illnesses rose by 25%, according to the CDC. Although 2009 had the highest number of Lyme disease cases on record with just under 30,000 cases for the year, cases have been on the rise for the past decade. The only reprieve in Lyme infections came in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the CDC.

Beyond research, some doctors are working to incorporate more education on Lyme disease in the medical community. Heidi S. Puc is a doctor at Integrative Medicine of CNY who works with patients to treat Lyme disease in a holistic way. Many patients come to Dr. Puc when they have been suffering from an unknown illness and she often ends up treating them for Lyme disease, she explained. 
</br>      </br>
“I can tell you this disease is not rare,” Puc said at the press conference. “It’s growing and it can mimic a lot of other illnesses. This is one area where we really have to educate the providers in our area because there are a lot of people suffering from Lyme disease that don't even realize they have it.”
</br>      </br>
Lyme disease is a complicated disease that makes solutions difficult for researchers and doctors. The people most affected by Lyme disease are those who have been infected. In some cases, the tick-borne illness almost cost people their life. It is a disease that many people learn to live with as they suffer from chronic symptoms. It can be a lonely, painful and scary disease. Experts continue to study Lyme disease and track the illness across the country, hoping to one day find the breakthrough they need to help people.
