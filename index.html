          <h3>“I’ve never been interested in being invisible and erased.”<h3>


          <p>Across the country, more than 100 bills have been introduced to curb the rights of transgender people. Advocacy groups such as the Human Rights Campaign are calling 2021 a record-breaking year for such legislation.</p>

          <p>The New York Division of Criminal Justice Services reports data on hate crimes by county and bias type. Under New York State’s Hate Crime Law, a person commits a hate crime when an offense targets a victim because of a perception or belief about their race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability, or sexual orientation. It also includes an act that is committed as a result of a person’s perception or belief about an identity group. These types of crimes can target an individual or a group of individuals.<p>

        <P>In 2021, there were a total of 114 hate crimes against LGBTQ+ people in New York State, not including property damage. In this context, hate crimes mean direct crimes against a person. The highest number of hate crimes occurred against gay males. Transgender individuals in New York faced the second-highest number of hate crimes in the queer community with a total of 23 in 2021.<p>
        
        <p>New York State has been tracking hate crimes against transgender individuals since 2010. However, the first reported hate crime wasn’t reported in the state until 2014. During the contentious 2016 election year, transgender people in New York faced 17 hate crimes. The highest year on record became 2021 after a reported 23 hate crimes against persons.<p>

        <p>The State of New York tracks hate crime data by separating it into counties. Some counties such as Onondaga County have no reported cases of anti-trans hate crimes. Queens, NY has the highest number of hate crimes against transgender individuals with 8 reported cases. New York, NY has the second highest number with 4.<p>

        <p>In addition to facing hate crimes, the transgender community continues to face political scrutiny. In 2021 alone, 31 states introduced bills that ban transgender athletes from participating in sports consistent with their gender identities. Three states – Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee – already signed these bills into law in 2021. <p>

        <p>“In a year that has taken a toll on each and every one of us, it is shocking that anti-equality extremists in state legislatures across this country have dedicated an unprecedented amount of time and energy to attacking the LGBTQ community and particularly LGBTQ youth,” said The Human Rights Campaign. <p>
